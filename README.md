# Income Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes income levels using machine learning models like **Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost**, and others. The goal is to accurately classify individuals as earning **≤50K or >50K** based on various socio-economic factors.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** [Dataset Link](https://example.com)
- **Features Used:** Education, Occupation, Hours Worked, Capital Gain, etc.

## 🚀 Models Implemented
✔ Logistic Regression  
✔ Support Vector Machine (SVC)  
✔ Random Forest  
✔ XGBoost  
✔ AdaBoost  
✔ Gradient Boosting  
✔ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Education and Capital Gain** are strong predictors of income.
- **Ensemble models (XGBoost, Gradient Boosting)** yielded the best accuracy (~88%).
- **Feature scaling (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler)** improved SVC performance.
- **SMOTE was applied** to handle class imbalance for better prediction fairness.
